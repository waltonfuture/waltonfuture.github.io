        Hi, my name is Lai Wei (魏来) and I am a junior student at SJTU, majoring in physics. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, 
        and have been working on NLP during my bachelor studies. I dedicate to staying current with the latest developments in NLP and 
        am constantly seeking new ways to innovate in this area and push the boundaries 
        of what is possible with AI. As a creative and curious individual, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
        My recent research focuses on the improvement of BART(a pretrained language model)'s decoder for better
        performance on natural language understanding and I intend to apply for an AI master/phd degree next year.
